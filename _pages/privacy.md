We maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction. We have implemented various security measures to protect both the personal information and the general information that we receive from you through the Service. Whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that information. Although we seek to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for the disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized access by third parties, or other causes beyond our control.

We retain personal information about you for as long as necessary to provide you with our Service or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your personal information. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of information, we consider who we collected the information from, our need for the personal information, why we collected the personal information, and the sensitivity of the personal information. In some cases, we retain personal information for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
